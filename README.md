# KMeansHousingDataset

## This assignment has two objectives: 
1. Understanding how to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm for a real dataset.
2. Develop a pipeline to solve the problem and provide accurate output using basic programming logic.
 
## Problem: 
Write a Python program using the provided template to find the best K in the KMeans 
algorithm using the Silhouette Coefficient metric for the 'housing.csv' dataset. The program should 
accept two integers that define the range of K values and output only the best K and nothing else.  
Instructions: Download the template program and write your code in the designated location 
mentioned in the comments. Initialize the K-Means model: You must use n_init='auto' and 
random_state=0 as KMeans model parameters. Use the given dataset (housing.csv) and calculate the 
Silhouette Coefficient for the range of K provided. Output the best K with respect to the Silhouette 
Coefficient.
